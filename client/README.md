# CastexSki - Client application

The CastexSki client application.

## Compile

To compile the client and update the stubs:

```bash
mvn clean package
```

## Update stubs

To update stubs from .wsdl files:

```bash
mvn cxf-codegen:wsdl2java
```

## Run

To run the client:

```bash
mvn exec:java
```

## Update

To update the client after a server web service modification, you should execute the following steps:

1. Download or copy the modified service from its remote web-page adding ```?wsdl``` at the end of the address.

2. Place the new ```.wsdl``` service file into ```src/main/resources/``` replacing the old one.
    **If there is no old one**, either
  - the name changed. In that case, rename the new as the old **OR** keep the new one but then don't forget to:
    - delete the old file.
    - refactor the client API ```CastexSkiAPI.java```, maven setup ```pom.xml``` and all the concerned imports in the client's classes.
  - or it is a new service. In that case:
    - add a new ```<wsdlOption>``` in the ```pom.xml```
    - add the new service initiator in the ```CastexSkiAPI.java```
    
3. Compile to update java from WSDLs.

## Add commands to the CLI

To add a command when its java class is ready, just add ```NewCommand.class``` as an argument of the ```register``` method into the ```src/main/java/RootCLI.java``` (and others runnable classes or sub-CLIs) constructor. 
Then, compile and run the client.
